# Runes to My Memory
- A 2d Memory Game made in Unity.
- I got the inspiration for the game name from [Amon Amarth's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S9iruQus1s&ab_channel=MetalBladeRecords "Amon Amarth") song with the same name.
- Link to a WebGL playable version: https://razvanmanolache.itch.io/runes-to-my-memory
- In this project I learnt how to setup a propely GameManager script, with a game state machine.
