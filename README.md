# Runes to My Memory
- A 2d Memory Game made in Unity (2020.3.19f1).
- I got the inspiration for the game name from [Amon Amarth's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S9iruQus1s&ab_channel=MetalBladeRecords "Amon Amarth - Runes to my Memory") song with the same name.
- Link to a WebGL playable version: https://razvanmanolache.itch.io/runes-to-my-memory
- In this project I learnt how to setup a propely GameManager script, with a game state machine and a little bit of post processing.

# How to play?
- Select a rune to reveal it and match with another.
- You will win when you will match all the runes.
- You get a combo multiplier if you match the runes one after another ( 2 pairs = 2x10points, 3 pairs = 3x10points )
- The Debug toggle shows the rune id on UI.
